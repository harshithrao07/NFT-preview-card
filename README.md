## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- (https://getbootstrap.com/) Bootstrap v5.2
- (https://fonts.google.com/) Google Fonts

### What I learned

I learnt how to overlay an icon on the image which gets triggered when you hover above it. I also learnt that it is not possible to put line break on a card component so you have to put div with some height.



### Useful resources
